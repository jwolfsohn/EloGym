Role: You are an expert Ruby on Rails Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer.

Task: Create the Frontend for the "EloGym" web application using Ruby on Rails 7+ with Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus) and TailwindCSS. This frontend should be integrated directly into the Rails backend we previously defined (Monolithic architecture).

1. Design & Tech Stack Philosophy
Framework: Ruby on Rails 7+ (Server-Side Rendered ERB).
Interactivity: Hotwire (Turbo Drive, Turbo Frames, Turbo Streams). Use Stimulus for small DOM manipulations.
Styling: TailwindCSS for rapid, modern, utility-first styling. The design aesthetic should be "Dark Mode & Premium" (Dark grays bg-zinc-900, Purple accents text-purple-500, Rounded corners, Glassmorphism).
Icons: Use heroicons or font-awesome helpers.

2. Key Layouts & Navigation
Global Layout (application.html.erb)
Top Nav: Minimalist. Shows the "Profile" link/avatar in the top-right.
Bottom Nav (Sticky Footer):
Dashboard (Home icon)
Matchmaking (Swords/Battle icon)
Rank (Trophy/Chart icon)
Conditional Rendering: Hide navigation on "Onboarding", "Login", and "Signup" pages.

3. Core Views to Implement

A. Dashboard (dashboard#index)
This is the main landing page.

Date Navigator: A centralized date picker (Previous Day < [ Today ] > Next Day). Use a Turbo Frame here so clicking next/prev only updates the workout list, not the whole page.
Stats Header: Displays current "Rank" (S/A/B...) and "Total Points".
Workout List:
Render a partial exercises/_exercise_card.html.erb for each active exercise.
Exercise Card:
Name (e.g., "Bench Press")
Target Specs (e.g., "3 Sets x 5 Reps @ 135 lbs")
"Complete" Button: Uses Turbo Stream to mark the exercise done, update the user's points in real-time, and grey out the card without a page reload.

B. Onboarding Flow (Wizard)
Welcome Page: Hero text + "Get Started" button.
Split Selection: Card selection for "PPL" vs "Arnold". Action saves preference via AJAX.
Starting Stats: Form to input initial Max Lifts (Bench, Squat, etc.) to calibrate the Elo system.

C. Matchmaking / Social (battles#index)
Friends List: Iterate through friends. Button to "Challenge".
Active Battles: List of pending/ongoing battles.
Search: A search bar to find users. Use a Stimulus controller to debounce input and search via Turbo Frame.

D. User Profile (users#show)
Avatar/Rank Badge: Large visual display of current Rank.
Stats Grid: Best lifts, Join date, Friends count.
Settings: Links to edit profile (password, email).

4. Specific Javascript/Stimulus Requirements
confetti_controller.js: Trigger a confetti explosion (using a library like canvas-confetti) when a workout is fully completed or a rank is updated.
modal_controller.js: Standard Close/Open logic for the "Battle Challenge" popup.
toggle_controller.js: For switching between "Demo Mode" and "Real Mode" on the dashboard (if you choose to keep that feature).

5. Deliverables
Layout File: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb with the navigation logic.
View Templates: The high-level ERB files for Dashboard, Profile, and Battles.
Partials: Reusable _exercise.html.erb and _friend.html.erb.
Tailwind Configuration: Ensure the generic tailwind.config.js includes the specific color palette (Brand Purple: #7c3aed, Background: #1e1e1e).
